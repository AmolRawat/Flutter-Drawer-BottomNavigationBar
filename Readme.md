Addition of Drawer-BottomNavigationBar in Home-Page.

I have used : https://flutlab.io/ to develop Drawer-BottomNavigationBar.apk file.

You can use this code and create an app in android studio and use emulater to run your and youn also connect your phone via USB and see you output in your mobile app in case if you don't have android studio installed in your laptop you can run it in flutlab.io also.
